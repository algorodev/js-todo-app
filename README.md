## Introduction

The Todo App is a simple, user-friendly application designed to help individuals manage their daily tasks efficiently.
Built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, this app offers a sleek, responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile
browsers. Users can add and delete tasks, and mark tasks as completed, with persistence of the data on the browser.

## Stack

- **HTML** - Markup language for web pages.
- **CSS** - Styles web content.
- **Javascript** - High-level, interpreted programming language.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Easily add new tasks to your todo list.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks from your list once they are no longer needed.
- **Mark as Completed:** Check off tasks as you complete them, keeping track of your accomplishments.
- **Persistence:** Your tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they remain available across sessions.
